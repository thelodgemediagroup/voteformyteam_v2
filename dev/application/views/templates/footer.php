American Red Cross provides relief to those affected by disasters and empowers individuals in our community to prevent, prepare for, and respond to emergencies 24 hours a day. Working with our network of generous donors, volunteers, and employees, we provide compassionate care to our clients at a time they need it most. In addition to our disaster preparedness and response efforts, we also provide support for local military families during emergencies, teach our neighbors lifesaving skills such as first aid, CPR and AED; and provide access to lifesaving blood services.
